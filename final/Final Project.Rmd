In this project, we are going to be applying multiplie linear regression and logistic regresion to a dataset about houses. 

The data set consists of 24 explanatory variables and our response variable SalesPrice. There are both categorical and continuous variables in the
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fastDummies)
house <- read.csv("housing.csv")
attach(house)
library(leaps)
house_dummy <- dummy_cols(house)

```

```{r}
drop <- c("Alley", "LotConfig", "Foundation", "AC", "KitchenQual", "GarageFinish")
house_dummy <- house_dummy[, !(names(house_dummy) %in% drop)]
house_dummy
```

```{r}
hist(house_dummy[,"SalePrice"])

#plot(SalePrice~., data = house_dummy)
boxplot(house)
```

Linear regression - iid residuals
```{r}
cor(house_dummy[, c("LotConfig_CulDSac", "LotConfig_Corner", "LotConfig_FR2", "LotConfig_FR3", "LotConfig_Inside")])
```

```{r}

model <- lm(SalePrice~.-Ã¯..Order-Foundation-LotConfig-AC-Alley-YearRemod-HalfBath-KitchenQual-GarageFinish-PorchSF-YrSold, data = house)
summary(model)
hist(model$residuals)
qqnorm(model$residuals)
qqline(model$residuals)
```

dim(house_dummy)
```
