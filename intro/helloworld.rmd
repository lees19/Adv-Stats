This is introduction to R Markdown class for section one of Advanced Statistics. 

```{r}
2 + 5
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x) 
sd
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
```

I can add text here...

```{r}
data(cars)
#summary(cars)
#head(cars)
#tail(cars)
speed <- cars$speed
mean(Speed)
dist <- cars$dist
plot(dist, speed)
```

As distance increases, speed tends to increase as well. 

```{r}
fit <- lm(cars$speed~cars$dist)
plot(speed~dist)
abline(fit, col = "red")


```
